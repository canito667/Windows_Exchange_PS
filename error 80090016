FIX 2 – Rename Azure Active Directory Authentication Plugin
By default, Outlook or rather should I say Office 365 on Windows 10 V1703 or later uses Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) framework-based authentication. 
Microsoft says, Office build 16.0.7967 or later, uses Web Account Manager (WAM) for sign-in workflows. This issue can be fixed by renaming the plugin used for the authentication 
purpose. You need to sign in with different account or perform this workaround from a network share and make sure the client facing this account is signed off. 
Then try these steps:

1. Press W8K + R and type %appdata%\Local\Packages and press Enter key or click OK.

2. Under Packages folder, rename the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy to Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy.old.

3. Note that Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy folder will be automatically recreated as soon as the affected client log in. Start Outlook and allow organization to 
manage the device. If you get any TPM error, ignore it and continue using Outlook. The error may no longer appearing then.
